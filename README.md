# I Am Sorry

I Am Sorry That You Struggle So Much To Give Your Self The Kindness You Deserve

I Am Sorry That You Struggle So Much To Give Your Self The Love You Deserve

I Am Sorry That You Struggle So Much To Give Your Self The Respect You Deserve

## Truth Be Told

### I Have Also Struggled With Self Image

So I Developed Dysmorphia Because Of My Unique Physical Features

**I Have Also Been Unhappy With My Physical Appearance Before**

So I Developed Eating Disorders Because Of Constant Remarks From My Family About My Weight

**I Have Also Been Used For My Body Before**

So I Developed Habits Which Led To Me Becoming Further Traumatized To The Benefit Of Others

**I Have Also Been Abused By Manipulators Before**

So I Developed Substance Abuse Problems And Other Addictions In Order To Cope With The Constant Pain

**I Have Also Been Afraid Of Being Alone Before**

So I Developed Toxic Relationships With Abusers Because It Was All I Had Previously Known

**And No Body Should Ever Have To Feel The Way We Felt Then**

I Know Now That I Did Not Deserve To Be Treated That Way By Myself And Others

**And You Do Not Deserve To Be Treated This Way Either**

**And It Is Not Healthy For Us To Lose Who We Are Just For The Comfort Of Some One Else**

## So Please Listen

You Deserve A Partner Who Will Give You The Same Kindness That You Deserve To Give Your Self

You Deserve A Partner Who Will Give You The Same Love That You Deserve To Give Your Self

You Deserve A Partner Who Will Give You The Same Respect That You Deserve To Give Your Self

## So Please Look

For A Partner Who Will Not Be Unfaithful To You Then Cite Their Own Insecurities

For A Partner Who Will Not Go Behind Your Back When They Know What They Are Doing Is Wrong

For A Partner Who Will Not Accuse You Of Doing The Same Immoral Actions Which They Constantly Revel In

## So Please Pray

To One Day Find Some One Who Will Deliver You Safety In The Face Of Danger

To One Day Find Some One Who Will Deliver You Loyalty In The Face Of Temptation

To One Day Find Some One Who Will Deliver You Comfort In The Face Of Hardship

## So Please Ask

Do You Feel The Same Kindness Returned To You Which You So Generously And Selflessly Give To Them?

Do You Feel The Same Love Returned To You Which You So Generously And Selflessly Give To Them?

Do You Feel The Same Loyalty Returned To You Which You So Generously And Selflessly Give To Them?

Do You Feel The Same Respect Returned To You Which You So Generously And Selflessly Give To Them?

## And Please Think

Do You Want Your Future Children To Experience All Of This Too?

Because I Know My Answer To That Question.

**Psalm 139:14**
